          The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl.
          Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
          of
          2018, up
          from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. Humans keep
          chickens
          primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally
          raised
          for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period
          (4th–2nd
          centuries BCE).

          Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯,
          sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as
          seafood,
          often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is
          "sushi
          rice",
          also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯)
